# Fields

So far we've focused on the tangent space (and its dual) at a single point $p\in\mathcal{M}$. As physicists, we are interested in *vector fields*, i.e. a vector at every point in space. The rigorous way to do this is the **Theory of Bundles**. So, we develope it... 

## Bundles 

**Definition**: A bundle is a triple $E\xrightarrow{\pi}M$ where 

- $E$ is a smooth manifold called the *total space*
- $\pi:E\to M$ is the smooth, surjective *projection map* 
- $M$ is a smooth manifold called the *base space*

Any 3 pieces of data like this are called a bundle. 


### Example: The cylinder
We can think of $E$ as a cylinder, $M$ as a circle, and $\pi$ chosen to to project the point on the cylinder vertically down to $z=0$ on the circle. See $fig-cylinderbundle

**Definition**: Given a bundle $(E,\pi, M)$, we define the *fibre over $p$* as $\text{preim}_\pi(\{p \})$


**Definition**: A section $\sigma$ is a map $\sigma:M\to E$ (i.e. this goes the other way!) with the requirement that 
\begin{equation}
    \pi \circ \sigma = \text{Id}_M
\end{equation}


As physicists now, we may consider our manifold $\mathcal{M}$ where the fibres over each $p\in\mathcal{M}$ are just $T_p\mathcal{M}$. *What would the sections be?* A section here would be a map that gives a vector for every point $p\in\mathcal{M}$. **This is exactly what we think of when we think of vector fields**. 

**Summary:** The sections are our physics notion of *fields*. The type of field is determined by the type of fibre. [^1]

[^1]: In quantum mechanics we talk about *wavefunctions*. They are not functions. Wave functions are really sections of a bundle so that $\psi:\mathcal{M}\to\mathbb{C}$. This is important because it impacts your notion of differentation: Is the momentum operator $p_i = -i\hbar \partial_i$ or $p_i=-i\hbar\nabla_i$?


The natual next question is *what is the total space* we are thinking of? Can we collect each $T_p\mathcal{M}$ into a smooth manifold?

## Tangent Bundle of a Smooth Manifold

Let $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O}, \mathscr{A})$ be a smooth manifold. We define the **Tangent Bundle** 

1. as a set, it is the *disjoint* union of tangent spaces: 
\begin{equation}
    T\mathcal{M} := \bigcup\limits_{p\in \mathcal{M}}^\bullet T_p\mathcal{M}
\end{equation}

2. The surjective projection map is $\pi:T\mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ with 
\begin{equation}
    X \mapsto p 
\end{equation}

At this point we need to turn $T\mathcal{M}$ into a smooth manifold. First we make $T\mathcal{M}$ into a topological manifold by equipping it with a topology. Since we already have a topology on $\mathcal{M}$ what we do is to construct a topology on $T\mathcal{M}$ that is the coarsest possible topology such that $\pi$ becomes continuous, i.e. the *initial topology* with respect to $\pi$: 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{O}_{T\mathcal{M}} := \left\{ \text{preim}_\pi(\mathcal{U}) \Big\vert \mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{M}\right\}
\end{equation}
This makes sense as we definitly want $\pi$ to be continuous and therefor it must map open sets to open sets.

Now we construct a $C^{\infty}$ atlas on $T\mathcal{M}$ from $\mathscr{A}$ we already have on $\mathcal{M}$. 
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{A}_{T\mathcal{M}} := \left\{ (T\mathcal{U}, \xi_x) \Big\vert (\mathcal{U}, x)\in \mathscr{A} \right\}
\end{equation}
where[^2]
\begin{align}
    \xi_x&: T\mathcal{U} \to \mathbb{R}^{2\text{ dim}\mathcal{M}} \\ 
    X &\mapsto \left( (x^1\circ \pi)(X), ... , (x^d\circ\pi)(X), (dx^1)_{\pi(x)}(X), ..., (dx^d)_{\pi(x)}(X) \right)
\end{align}

[^2]: These $(dx^j)_{\pi(x)}(X)$ are just a fancy way of writing the vector components $X^j$ since 
\begin{aligned}
    (dx^j)_{\pi(x)}X &= dx^j\left( X^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right) \\ 
        &= X^i dx^j\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right)\\
        &= X^i \left(\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial x^i} \right)\\
        &= X^i\delta^j_i = X^j
\end{aligned}

 Further, we may consider the inverse of the chartmap 
 \begin{align}
    \xi_x^{-1}&: \xi_x(T\mathcal{U}) \to T\mathcal{U} \\ 
    (\alpha^1,...\alpha^d, \beta^1, ... \beta^d) &:= \beta^i\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)_{x^{-1}(\alpha^1, ..., \alpha^d)}
 \end{align}

Now we must ask: *are these chart maps smooth?*

\begin{align}
    &(\xi_y\circ\xi_x^{-1})(\alpha^1,...\alpha^d,\beta^1,...,\beta^d) = \xi_y\left(\beta^i\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)_{x^{-1}(\alpha^1, ..., \alpha^d)}\right)\\
 &\qquad = \Big(..., (y^i\circ\pi)\left(\beta^n\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right)_{x^{-1}(\alpha^1, ..., \alpha^d)}\right),..., \\ 
 &\qquad\qquad ...,(dy^i)_{x^{-1}(\alpha^1,...\alpha^d)}\left(\beta^n\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right)_{x^{-1}(\alpha^1, ... , \alpha^d)}\right) ,... \Big) \\ 
 &\qquad = \left(..., (y^i\circ x^{-1})(\alpha^1,...,\alpha^d),..., ...,\beta^n dy^i\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right) , ... \right) \\ 
 &\qquad = \left(..., (y^i\circ x^{-1})(\alpha^1,...,\alpha^d),..., ...,\beta^n \left(\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^n}\right) , ... \right) \\ 
\end{align}
Is this a smooth map? Yes, because the chart transition map $y^i\circ x^{-1}$ are smooth and so are the change of coordinate functions $\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}$. 

Thus, we can conclude that $(T\mathcal{M}, \pi, \mathcal{M})$ really is a bundle which we call the **Tangent bundle**



## Vector Fields

**Definition**: A smooth vector field $\chi$ is a smooth section of the tangent bundle $(T\mathcal{M}, \pi, \mathcal{M})$, i.e. 
\begin{align}
    &\chi:\mathcal{M}\to T\mathcal{M} \\ 
    &\pi\circ\chi = \text{Id}_\mathcal{M}
\end{align}


## The $C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})$-module $\Gamma(T\mathcal{M})$

**Definition**: We define $\Gamma(T\mathcal{M})$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma(T\mathcal{M}) = \left\{ \chi:T\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}\Big\vert \text{ smooth section } \right\}
\end{equation}
which we equip with addition by[^1] 
\begin{equation}
    (\chi + \tilde\chi)(f) := \chi f + \tilde\chi f
\end{equation}

[^1]: Note: here we have extended the action of a vector at a point on a function to the action of a vector field on a manifold in the obvious way, i.e.
\begin{aligned}
    &\chi f: \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} \\ 
    &p \mapsto \chi(p)f
\end{aligned}

as well as multiplication[^2] via 
\begin{aligned}
    (g\cdot \chi)(f) := g\cdot \chi(f)
\end{aligned}

[^2]: We do not mean s-multiplication here. We can multiply by any $g\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})$ since we can define the multiplication pointwise using multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$. 

The special case of a vector field over the ring is called a **module**.


**Upshot**: The set of all smooth vector fields can be made into a $C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})$-module.

We can now use $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}:\mathcal{U}\to T\mathcal{U}$ with no supscript for the point to denote the coordinate induced vector field.


## Tensor Fields
In much the same way as we constructed $\Gamma(T\mathcal{M})$, we can define the cotangent fields via $\Gamma(T^*\mathcal{M})$ using the cotangent bundle $(T^*\mathcal{M}, \pi, \mathcal{M})$. With these two objects in hand, we proceed to tensor fields. 

**Definition**: An $(r,s)$-tensor field $T$ is a $C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})$-multi-linear map 
\begin{equation}
    T: \Gamma(T^*\mathcal{M})\times \underset{r}{...}\times  \Gamma(T^*\mathcal{M})\times  \Gamma(T^\mathcal{M})\underset{s}{...}\times \Gamma(T^\mathcal{M}) \xrightarrow{\sim} C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})
\end{equation}


### Example 
For any $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M})$, we define 
\begin{align}
    &df : \gamma(T\mathcal{M}) \xrightarrow{\sim} C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M}) \\ 
    &\chi \mapsto df(\chi)
\end{align}
where $(\chi f)(p) = \chi(p)f$.
