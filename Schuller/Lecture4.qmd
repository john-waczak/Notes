# Differentiable Manifolds

We are now considering differentiable manifolds. So far, we looked at topological manifolds which, roughly speaking, we would like to extend to allow us to define a velocity to each point on a curve. Is the structure $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O})$ enough to talk about differentiability of curves? No! We need to make more choices (i.e. add more structure) before we can discuss differentiablility of a curve. 

We wish to define a notion of differentiable...
\begin{align}
\gamma &:\mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{M} \text{  (curves)  } \\ 
f&:\mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} \text{  (functions)  } \\
\phi &: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{N} \text{  (maps)  } \\
\end{align}


## Strategy

Let's consider curves $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{M}$. We don't know what to do with this object on a manifold so what do we do? We consider the *portion* of the curve that lies in the chart domain of $(U, x)$.

The idea is to try to *lift* the undergraduate notion of differentiability of the curve on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (i.e. of $x\circ\gamma$) to a notion of differentiability of the curve on the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ (i.e. of $\gamma$ itself**.

**Problem**: How do we make this well defined under change of chart? In other words, in @fig-diagram2 does differentiability of $x\circ\gamma$ *guarantee* differentiability of $y\circ\gamma$?

From @fig-diagram2, we see that
\begin{align}
    y \circ \gamma &= (y\circ x^{-1}) \circ (x \circ \gamma) \\ 
    &= y \circ (x^{-1} \circ x) \circ \gamma
\end{align}

We already confirmed that $x\circ \gamma$ is (undergraduate) differentiable as a function from $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^d$. Since we are working with topological manifolds and assuming that the chart transition maps are *continuous*, then the most we can say about $y\circ x^{-1}$ is that it is continuous. As we are composing a continuous map with a differentiable map, the answer is that $y\circ \gamma$ is *maybe* differentiable. 

What is the remedy for this problem? 


## Compatible Charts 
In the previous section, we considered *any* imaginable charts $(\mathcal{U}, x)$ in our topological manifold $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O})$.[^1] We have seen that this is not sufficient to enable differentiablility of curves, functions, and maps. Therefore, we seek to limit the set of allowed charts to *only those charts* whose transition maps are differentiable.

[^1]: To emphasise this, we may say that we took these charts $(\mathcal{U}, x)$ from the **maximal Atlas** $\mathscr{A}$ of $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O})$.

**Definition**: Two charts $(\mathcal{U}, x)$ and $(\mathcal{V}, y)$ are called $\ast$-compatible if either: 

- $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V} = \empty$
- $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V} \neq \empty$ and the chart transition maps $y\circ x^{-1}$ and $x \circ y^{-1}$ are (undergraduate) $\ast$.[^2]

[^2]: Here we use $\ast$ as there are different types of compatibility we may care about. Here, we are specifically interested in *differentiably compatible*. 

**Definition**: An atlas $\mathscr{A}_{\ast}$ is an $\ast$-compatible atlas if for any two charts in $\mathscr{A}_{\ast}$, the charts are $\ast$-compatible.

For *physics* this is a really down to Earth question. *Am I choosing the right structure here?*

| $\ast$ | udergraduate - $\ast$ | description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| $C^0$ | $C^{0}:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ | continuous maps w.r.t. $\mathcal{O}_{st}$ | 
| $C^{1}$ | $C^1:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ | differentiable (once) with continuous result |
| $C^k$ | $\vdots$ | $k$-times continuously differentiable [^3] | 
| $D^k$ | $\vdots$ | $k$-times differentiable | 
| $C^\infty$ | $\vdots$ | infinitely differentiable, aka *smooth* | 
| $C^\omega$ | $\vdots$ | $\exists$ a multidemnsional Taylor expansion | 
| $\mathbb{C}^\infty$ |  $\vdots$ | For even dimensional manifold that are smooth *and* satisfy the generalized *Cauchy-Riemann* conditions [^4] |

[^3]: Typically, $C^k$ is more favored than $D^k$.

[^4]: Generally, the further down you go in this table, the more conditions you add and therebore more resitrictions you impose on your atlas $\mathscr{A}$.

The natural *next* question is: *To what degree to derivatives appear in physics?* It turns out we don't need to worry! 

**Theorem**: (Whitney) Any $C^k$-atlas, $\mathscr{A}_{C^k}$ with $k\geq 1$ *contains* a $C^\infty$ atlas.

Upshot: If we have a $C^k$ atlas, we can always keep tossing out charts until we are left with a $C^\infty$ atlas.[^5]

[^5]: Thus we may always consider smooth $C^\infty$ manifolds without loss of generality unless we wish to define Taylor Expandability, Complex Differentiability, ...



## Diffeomorphisms 

Consider maps $\Phi:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{N}$

- If $M,N$ are naked sets, the *structure preserving* maps are the **bijections** (the invertible maps)
  - A set $M$ and $N$ are called *set-theoretically* **isomorphic**, $M\cong N$ if there exists a bijection $\Phi$ between them.[^6] 
- If we have topoologies $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O}_M)$, $(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{O}_N)$, the *structure-preserving* maps are the homeomorphisms (i.e. continuous bijections)
  - If this exists, then we call the two spaces *topologically* **isomorphic** (or homeomorphic)
- If we have vector spaces $U, V$. Then the *structure-preserving* maps are again **bijections** that are both ways **linear**
- Two $C^\infty$ manifolds $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{O}_m, \mathscr{A}_m)$ and $(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{O}_n, \mathscr{A}_n)$ are said to be **Diffeomorphic** if a bijection, $\Phi$ exists and $\Phi$ and $\Phi^{-1}$ are both $C^{\infty}$ maps.[^7]
 
[^6]: $\mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{N}\cong \mathbb{Q}$, but $\mathbb{N}\not{\cong} \mathbb{R}$.
